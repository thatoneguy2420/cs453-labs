# Lab 1 - TCP Command Server

In this lab, you will extend a simple TCP echo server into a small command-based TCP server.

The lecture example showed a basic client/server program where the client sends text and the server echoes the same text back. This lab builds on that idea by adding a simple command protocol.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

* Explain the difference between a TCP client and a TCP server.
* Run a TCP server and connect to it with a client.
* Send and receive text over a socket.
* Implement simple command parsing.
* Use automated tests to check server command behavior.
* Describe a small text-based protocol.

## Starter Code Structure

The starter code is located in:

```
labs/lab01-tcp-command/starter/
```

The starter project has this structure:

```
starter/
├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── client.js
│   ├── commands.js
│   └── server.js
└── test/
    └── commands.test.js
```

### File Descriptions

| File                    | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server.js`         | Starts the TCP server, accepts client connections, reads client input, and sends responses. |
| `src/client.js`         | Provides a simple command-line TCP client for testing the server manually.                  |
| `src/commands.js`       | Contains the command-handling logic. Most of your work will be here.                        |
| `test/commands.test.js` | Contains automated tests for the command-handling logic.                                    |
| `package.json`          | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts.                                    |

## Required Features

1. The server must accept TCP client connections on a configurable port.
2. The client must send one command at a time.
3. The server must support `ECHO`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, and `QUIT`.
4. The server must return an error for unknown commands.
5. The server must not crash when the client sends an empty line.
6. The README must describe the protocol.

### Graduate Students

7. Implement `REVERSE` or `TIME` or add a new command and document it. 

## Command Protocol

The server accepts one text command per line.

Commands are case-insensitive, but the command arguments should be handled as normal text.

| Client sends    | Server responds     |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| `ECHO hello`    | `hello`             |
| `UPPER hello`   | `HELLO`             |
| `LOWER HELLO`   | `hello`             |
| `REVERSE hello` | `olleh`             |
| `TIME`          | current server time |
| `QUIT`          | closes connection   |
| unknown command | error message       |

## Running the Lab

First, move into the starter directory:

```
cd labs/lab01-tcp-command/starter
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the server:

```
npm run server
```

In a second terminal, move into the same starter directory and run the client:

```
npm run client
```

You should be able to type commands into the client and see responses from the server.

Example:

```
> ECHO hello
hello

> UPPER hello
HELLO

> QUIT
Goodbye.
```

## Configuring the Port

The server should use port `3000` by default.

You can run the server on a different port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```
PORT=4000 npm run server
```

Then run the client using the same port:

```
PORT=4000 npm run client
```

## Testing

This lab includes automated tests for the command-handling logic.

Run the tests from the starter directory:

```
npm test
```

The tests are focused on `src/commands.js`.

That means you can work on the command behavior without needing to manually start the TCP server every time.

The main function being tested is:

```
handleCommand(line)
```

The tests check that commands such as `ECHO`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `REVERSE`, `TIME`, and `QUIT` return the expected responses.

Some tests may fail when you first receive the starter code. Your job is to update the implementation until the required tests pass.

You may also run the tests in watch mode if supported by the starter project:

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Suggested Workflow

1. Run the server and client before changing anything.
2. Try the existing commands manually.
3. Run the automated tests.
4. Open `src/commands.js`.
5. Implement one command at a time.
6. Run `npm test` after each change.
7. Once the tests pass, test manually with the client.
8. Update this README to describe the final protocol.

## Reflection Questions

Answer the following questions in your submission:

1. What is the difference between the client and the server?

The client and server perform distinct roles within a networked application. 
The client initiates communication by sending requests to the server, while the 
server listens for incoming connections, processes requests, and returns appropriate 
responses. In this lab, the client sends text-based commands and the server 
interprets those commands, executes the requested operation, and returns the 
resulting output.

2. Why does the server need to keep running after handling one request?

A server must remain active after processing a request so that it can continue 
providing services to connected clients and accept new client connections. If the 
server terminated after handling a single request, it would be unable to support 
ongoing communication or multiple requests over time. Continuous availability is 
a fundamental characteristic of client-server systems and enables reliable interaction 
between users and network services.

3. What happens if two clients connect at the same time?

When two clients connect simultaneously, the server must manage each 
connection independently. Modern server applications typically use concurrent processing 
techniques, such as asynchronous I/O, event-driven programming, or multithreading, to
handle multiple clients efficiently. This allows each client to send commands and receive 
responses without disrupting the communication of other connected clients.

4. How is this different from HTTP?

This lab utilizes a custom text-based protocol built directly on top of TCP sockets. 
Clients send commands as plain text, and the server responds with corresponding output. 
HTTP, while also operating over TCP, provides a standardized communication framework that 
includes request methods, status codes, headers, message formatting rules, and additional 
protocol features. As a result, HTTP is more structured and widely used for web-based 
applications, whereas the protocol implemented in this lab is intentionally simplified 
to demonstrate the underlying principles of client-server communication.



## Final Protocol Description

This application implements a simple command-based protocol using TCP sockets. 
After establishing a connection, the client sends a command as a line of text, 
and the server processes the command and returns a corresponding response. Commands
are case-insensitive, while command arguments are treated as normal text unless 
modified by the requested operation.
